# What is an image ? 

An image can be represented as a 2D function `F(x,y)` where `x` and `y` are spatial coordinates.

The `amplitude` of `F` at a particular value of `x`,`y` is known as the intensity of an image at that point.
If `x`,`y`, and the `amplitude` value is finite then we call it a digital image.

It is an array of pixels arranged in columns and rows.
Pixels are the elements of an image that contain information about intensity and color.

An image can also be represented in 3D where `x`,`y`, and `z` become spatial coordinates. 
Pixels are arranged in the form of a matrix. 
This is known as an RGB image.
