# [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/sequential_model) 

It is a user-friendly, modular, extensible library for TensorFlow. 
Since 2017, TensorFlow integrated Keras, so you don't need to install separately to use it.
There are some differences between the standalone version and the one embedded with TensorFlow. 
For this reason, you should make sure to use `import from tf.keras` in your code.
