## NumPy

[https://numpy.org/](https://numpy.org/)

A Python library that provides a `multidimensional array` object and objects such as `masked arrays` and `matrices`), 
and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

An image is essentially a standard NumPy array containing pixels of data points.

Therefore, by using basic NumPy operations, such as slicing, masking, and fancy indexing, you can modify the pixel values of an image. The image can be loaded using `skimage` and displayed using `Matplotlib`.

## Anaconda 

A free Python distribution that makes package management and deployment easy. 
It provides a python interpreter, a list of python packages, and some other related tools like editors, all in one. 
It's widely used for data analysis in Python. 

Miniconda is a smaller version of Anaconda.
