# Layer Types

## Dense

A dense layer is a type of layer that multiplies its inputs by a matrix (called weights) and then adds a number (called the bias) to the result.

## Conv2d

You can build an image classifier using only dense layers, however, convolutional layers have proven effective for many image based tasks.
