## categoricalCrossentropy

This is used when the output of our model is a probability distribution (multiple labels vs a single output).
It measures the error between the probability distribution generated by the last layer of our model and the probability distribution given by our true label.

For example if the labels are 10 numbers between 1-10 :

`categoricalCrossentropy` will produce a single number indicating how similar the prediction vector is to our true label vector.
